# Building the Distributed Reactive State Solution of My Dreams

Let me paint a picture of what I'd actually build if I had no constraints. I'll skip the "it depends" hedging and give you an opinionated design.

## The Core Thesis

Every distributed reactive system today forces a bad tradeoff:

- **CRDTs** (Yjs, Automerge) → great offline, painful semantics, no transactions, no server authority
- **Server-authoritative** (Firebase, Supabase Realtime) → easy, but chatty and fragile offline
- **Local-first DBs** (Replicache, ElectricSQL, Zero) → close, but each picks a lane
- **Event sourcing** (Kafka + projections) → powerful, operationally brutal

Nobody has cleanly unified **sync + transactions + reactivity + offline + multi-writer** with good DX. That's the target.

---

## Architecture: Four Layers

### 1. The Data Model — Typed, Transactional, Relational

Not documents, not CRDTs-as-primitives. **Relational tables with typed schema, defined in one place, shared between client and server.**

```ts
// schema.ts — single source of truth
const Todo = table('todo', {
  id: uuid().primaryKey(),
  title: text().notNull(),
  done: boolean().default(false),
  listId: uuid().references(List.id),
  // conflict policy declared per-field, not per-system
})
```

Each field carries a **merge policy**: `lww`, `crdt-text`, `counter`, `server-authoritative`, `custom`. This is the key insight — merge semantics belong to *the field*, not the whole system. A `title` field and a `likes` counter want different strategies.

Mutations are **typed transactions**, not ad-hoc writes:

```ts
await db.tx(async (tx) => {
  const t = await tx.todo.insert({ title, listId })
  await tx.list.update(listId, l => l.todoCount.increment(1))
})
```

Transactions are the unit of atomicity, sync, and rebase. This gives you real relational integrity *and* offline capability.

### 2. The Sync Engine — Log-Based, Bidirectional, Causal

The client maintains a **local append-only op log** plus a materialized view (SQLite via WASM, or an in-memory store with SQLite persistence). The server does the same, plus holds the canonical state.

Sync protocol:
1. Client sends `{ lastServerSeq, ops[] }` — its unsynced ops with causal deps
2. Server validates against schema + auth + invariants, assigns a monotonic `seq`, rebases if needed
3. Server streams back `ops[]` since `lastServerSeq` (including ops from *other* clients, already rebased)
4. Client applies remote ops to local state, detects conflicts, resolves via field policies, optionally surfaces `conflict` events for custom resolution

**Key design choices:**
- **Causal consistency, not strong consistency.** Ops carry vector clocks or Lamport timestamps. You don't need global ordering to be correct — you need *causal* ordering.
- **Rebase over reject.** If a transaction conflicts with server state, rebase it against the new state rather than failing. Fall back to user-visible conflict only when rebase is impossible.
- **Server is authoritative on invariants, client is authoritative on intent.** Server enforces schema, auth, foreign keys, business rules. Client owns the UX of what the user meant.
- **Delta sync, not full snapshots.** But support snapshot resync for clients that fall too far behind (like Postgres WAL + base backup).

This is essentially **Replicache/ElectricSQL's model, generalized with field-level merge policies and typed transactions**. The magic is making it feel like a local database.

### 3. Reactivity — Fine-Grained, Subscription-Based, Network-Aware

UI subscribes to **queries**, not tables:

```ts
const todos = useQuery(q => q.todo.where(t => t.listId.eq(id)).orderBy('createdAt'))
```

The reactive layer diffs query results and re-runs on any relevant op. Requirements:

- **Fine-grained invalidation** — know which queries depend on which rows/fields, so an op on `todo.title` doesn't invalidate a query that only reads `todo.done`
- **Optimistic by default** — local tx applies immediately, UI updates, sync happens in background, rollback surfaces as a visible conflict event if rebase fails
- **Network-aware status** — every query exposes `{ data, pending, conflicted, syncedAt }` so UI can show "saving…" or "offline" without ceremony
- **Subscription coalescing** — batch op notifications per animation frame; no thrash

I'd build this on top of a signal graph (like Solid/Signals or a custom incremental computation engine) rather than React state, then provide bindings for React/Vue/Svelte/Solid. The reactive core should be framework-agnostic and testable without a UI.

### 4. The Transport — Pluggable, Resilient

WebSocket primary, HTTP long-poll fallback, WebRTC peer-to-peer optional for local mesh (great for collaborative editing on LAN or in a room). The sync protocol is **transport-agnostic** — same op log semantics over any pipe.

Critical: **the sync engine never depends on the transport being alive.** Offline is the default state; online is an optimization. This flips the mental model that kills most sync systems.

---

## The Things That Make It Actually Good

**Schema is code, shared everywhere.** One TypeScript definition → client types, server validation, migration generation, query builders. No drift.

**Migrations are first-class and distributed-safe.** Schema version is part of the sync protocol. Old clients can't corrupt new data; new clients can read old data. Migration = a transaction over ops, replicated.

**Auth is per-op, evaluated server-side, with a local mirror for optimistic checks.** Client knows what it *can* do (from a rules snapshot), server enforces authoritatively. Rules are code, deployed atomically with schema.

**Presence and ephemeral state are a separate, first-class channel.** Cursors, typing indicators, "who's online" — these are *not* synced ops. They're TTL'd, best-effort, CRDT-ish, and don't touch the op log. Mixing them with durable state is a classic mistake.

**Debuggability is designed in.** Every op has a trace: where it was created, its causal deps, how it was rebased, why it conflicted. A devtools panel shows the op log, the current view, pending sync, and conflict queue. This alone would put it ahead of everything that exists.

**Testing story:** time-travel over the op log, deterministic replay, property-based tests for merge policies, a "chaos" mode that drops/reorders/duplicates messages. If your sync engine can't survive `chaos` mode, it's not done.

---

## What I'd Explicitly *Not* Do

- **No CRDT-everything.** CRDTs for text, counters, sets — yes. CRDTs for relational invariants — no. Transactions are the right primitive for business logic.
- **No server-side rendering of synced state.** SSR the shell, hydrate the sync engine, but don't try to serialize the op log into HTML. It's a trap.
- **No "just use Postgres logical replication."** It's a great backend *source*, but it doesn't solve offline, optimistic UI, or field-level merge. Use it as the durability layer behind the sync server.
- **No framework lock-in.** Core is pure TS, zero React. Bindings are thin.

---

## The Honest Hard Parts

1. **Rebase correctness** — rebasing arbitrary transactions against concurrent state is genuinely hard. You need a restricted transaction language (no arbitrary reads-then-writes without declared dependencies) or you're building a mini-database with MVCC.
2. **Schema evolution under sync** — old ops need to be replayable against new schema. This is a migration *engine*, not a migration *script*.
3. **Permission changes mid-flight** — a user's rules change while they have pending ops. Server must rebase or reject gracefully, client must explain why.
4. **The "two tabs" problem** — multiple clients per user, shared local storage. Needs a local coordinator (SharedWorker) or you get op log divergence on the same device.

---

## TL;DR

**A typed, transactional, relational local-first database with field-level merge policies, a causal op-log sync engine that treats offline as the default state, framework-agnostic fine-grained reactivity over queries, and first-class debuggability — where the server enforces invariants and the client owns intent, and rebase is the default conflict strategy.**

That's the dream. The pieces exist (Replicache's sync model, ElectricSQL's shape, Automerge's text CRDTs, Signals' reactivity, Postgres' durability) — nobody has assembled them with the right primitives and the right defaults. The hardest part isn't any single layer; it's making the seams invisible.

<details><summary><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: monospace">[CHATGPT]</span> </strong></summary>

If I had absolutely nothing holding me back, I'd build a Distributed Reactive State Engine, not another state-management library.

I'd build something that combines the strongest ideas from:

- Disruptor architecture (extreme throughput).
- Distributed databases (replication and fault tolerance).
- Reactive programming (dependency propagation).
- Event sourcing (replayability and recovery).
- CRDTs (conflict-free distributed mutation).
- Actor systems (ownership and message routing).
- Shared-memory architectures (near-zero-cost local communication).

But I wouldn't simply combine existing technologies. I'd design the runtime around one fundamental idea:

State is a distributed, addressable, continuously replicated computation.

Here's how I'd approach it.

# 1. The architecture

APPLICATION / SSR / WORKERS / CLIENTS

Any runtime can participate in the state network

DISTRIBUTED STATE FABRIC

ADDRESS ROUTER

Ownership, scopes, routing

REPLICATION

Sync, consensus, reconciliation

SIGNAL ENGINE

Dependencies, subscriptions

TRANSPORT

Streams, duplex, delivery

STATE EXECUTION CORE

WRITE ENGINE

Commands, validation, ordering

READ ENGINE

Snapshots, queries, selectors

REACTIVE GRAPH

Incremental computation

BINARY STORAGE

Memory, persistence, indexes

DURABLE STATE + CHANGE LOG

Snapshots · WAL · Replication history · Recovery

I'd make these independent engines, coordinated by a very small runtime kernel.

# 2. Addressing would be the foundation

I wouldn't organize state around components, stores, or even atoms.

I'd organize it around globally addressable state.

Every piece of state gets an address:

`[root, master, context, slave, key]`

The address determines:

- Where the state lives.
- Who owns it.
- Which storage backend holds it.
- Which replication policy applies.
- Who can subscribe to it.
- How it is routed across processes.

This is important because it eliminates the need for separate addressing systems for atoms, stores, databases, and distributed messages.

They're all operating on the same address space.

I'd also make addresses routable without requiring callers to know where the underlying state physically lives.

# 3. A unified mutation engine

This would be one of the most important pieces.

I would NOT have separate write paths for:

- Local state.
- Distributed state.
- Persistent state.
- Reactive state.
- Database state.

Everything would enter through the same mutation pipeline.

For example:

```
state.set(key, value)
state.update(key, fn)
state.delete(key)
state.transaction(() => {})
```

Internally:

```
MUTATION
   |
   v
ADDRESS RESOLUTION
   |
   v
OWNERSHIP / VALIDATION
   |
   v
ORDERING
   |
   v
BINARY WRITE
   |
   +------> CHANGE LOG
   |
   +------> REACTIVE INVALIDATION
   |
   +------> REPLICATION
   |
   +------> PERSISTENCE
```

Crucially, these operations wouldn't all need to execute synchronously.

The local write could become visible immediately, while replication and persistence proceed asynchronously.

The engine would track which stages have completed.

# 4. The reactive engine

I'd build a dependency graph rather than a conventional subscription system.

Every computation becomes a node.

Nodes can depend on:

- Other state nodes.
- Computed values.
- Other distributed nodes.
- External resources.
- Async operations.

When a value changes, the engine propagates invalidation through the dependency graph.

But here's the important part:

I'd make invalidation incremental, versioned, and deduplicated.

If 10,000 mutations happen during one execution window, I don't necessarily want 10,000 downstream notifications.

I want the engine to identify affected dependencies, consolidate work, and calculate the minimum required updates.

I'd also distinguish:

| Operation | Behavior                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `set`     | Replace state                  |
| `update`  | Transform state                |
| `touch`   | Invalidate without replacement |
| `peek`    | Read without subscribing       |
| `sub`     | Subscribe to changes           |
| `derive`  | Create computed state          |
| `watch`   | Observe selected changes       |
| `stream`  | Consume continuous changes     |
| `duplex`  | Bidirectional communication    |

Computed state would be cached and versioned.

No unnecessary recomputation.

# 5. Distribution and consistency

This is where I'd be particularly careful.

I would NOT make everything a CRDT.

Different kinds of state need different consistency guarantees.

I'd support several native consistency models:

| Model     | Intended use                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Local     | Process-local state               |
| Eventual  | General distributed replication   |
| Causal    | Preserve causal dependencies      |
| LWW       | Last-writer-wins values           |
| CRDT      | Conflict-free collaborative state |
| Strong    | Consensus-backed mutations        |
| Exclusive | Single-owner mutation             |

For example:

- Counters: PN-counter.
- Sets: observed-remove set.
- Collaborative documents: sequence CRDT.
- Configuration: versioned register.
- Financial transactions: strongly consistent transaction.
- UI state: local or eventual.

Every state address would have a replication policy.

The transport wouldn't need to understand the data structure. It would transport operations and their metadata.

# 6. The binary storage engine

This is where I'd spend a ridiculous amount of engineering effort.

I wouldn't make JavaScript objects the fundamental storage representation.

I'd build a binary-first storage engine with:

- Contiguous memory arenas.
- Typed storage pages.
- Compact address indexes.
- Version tables.
- Operation journals.
- Snapshot pages.
- Zero-copy reads where possible.
- Specialized numeric storage.
- Efficient object serialization.

The important distinction:

The public API can be ergonomic without the internal representation being object-heavy.

I would retain a small amount of indexing metadata, but mutations and data movement would operate directly on binary structures wherever possible.

I'd also have storage adapters rather than forcing every workload into the same physical representation.

# 7. The transport layer

I'd make transport independent of storage and reactivity.

One transport interface, multiple implementations:

```
interface TRANSPORT {
    send(...args: any[]): any
    sub(...args: any[]): any
    stream(...args: any[]): any
    duplex(...args: any[]): any
}
```

Implementations could include:

- In-process shared transport.
- Worker transport.
- MessagePort.
- WebSocket.
- TCP.
- HTTP.
- SharedArrayBuffer.
- Cluster transport.

All using the same addressing and message envelope.

Every operation would have:

- An operation ID.
- An origin.
- A destination.
- A sequence.
- A causal version.
- An acknowledgement state.

Delivery would be at-least-once with deduplication, not an unrealistic promise of exactly-once network delivery.

I'd also build retransmission, backpressure, dead-letter handling, and replay directly into the transport fabric.

# 8. The most important feature: execution tiers

I'd design the runtime to understand that not all work needs the same execution guarantees.

For example:

| Tier | Execution                            |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Direct memory mutation               |
| 1    | Local reactive propagation           |
| 2    | Local asynchronous processing        |
| 3    | Cross-thread replication             |
| 4    | Cross-process replication            |
| 5    | Durable persistence                  |
| 6    | Consensus / distributed coordination |

A mutation shouldn't have to wait for tier 6 just because it needs tier 1 immediately.

The engine would expose completion stages so callers can choose how much certainty they need.

For example:

```
const result = state.set('user', user)

result.local
result.replicated
result.durable
```

These represent different guarantees, not different mutation APIs.

# 9. What I'd expose to developers

I'd keep the public API remarkably small.

Something along these lines:

```
const state = new DRX()

const count = state.atom('count', 0)

count.get()
count.set(10)
count.update(n => n + 1)
count.sub(fn)

const doubled = state.derive(
    () => count.get() * 2
)

const remote = state.connect({
    transport: 'worker',
    consistency: 'causal'
})

remote.share(count)

state.transaction(() => {
    count.set(20)
})

state.persist(count)
```

And critically, the same API would work whether the state was:

- Local.
- Shared between workers.
- Replicated between servers.
- Persisted to disk.
- Hydrated during SSR.
- Synchronized with a browser.

The runtime handles the difference.

# 10. What I would prioritize

I'd build it in this order:

1. Addressing and registry

   The universal state identity and routing layer.
2. Binary state engine

   Fast mutation, indexing, versioning, and snapshots.
3. Reactive execution engine

   Dependency graph, subscriptions, incremental propagation, transactions.
4. Replication engine

   Operation log, ordering, conflict resolution, consistency models.
5. Transport fabric

   Local, worker, process, and network communication.
6. Durability and recovery

   Journaling, checkpoints, replay, compaction, failover.
7. Adapters

   Framework integrations, databases, SSR, external stores, and developer tooling.

# My biggest architectural decision

I would make one distinction that I think separates a genuinely powerful solution from most existing state libraries:

The state engine, reactive engine, and distributed engine would be three independent systems sharing one underlying identity and execution model.

They wouldn't be three features bolted onto a store.

They'd be peers.

- The state engine knows what the value is.
- The reactive engine knows what depends on the value.
- The distributed engine knows where the value exists and how it gets there.

And the runtime coordinates them.

That separation allows each engine to be optimized independently without breaking the others.

One final thing: I wouldn't build this as a replacement for Redux, Zustand, Jotai, or any other state library.

I'd build it as infrastructure that those libraries could sit on top of.

The end goal would be that a developer never has to care whether a piece of state is local, distributed, reactive, persistent, or replicated. It's simply state.

That's the system I'd build.

<details><summary><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: monospace">[ROOL]</span> </strong></summary>

One thing, then everything else is a projection of it.

## The primitive: a cell is its own signal

Not "a value, and also a subscription system." A cell is `(address, log, value, version vector, shards)` — and the value is *the fold of the log*. The signal stream isn't attached to the container, it *is* the container's history. Reading `.value` and reading the stream are the same act at different resolutions. That's the invariant I'd never break again: if you can snapshot a cell, you can replay it; if you can replay it, you can replicate it; if you can replicate it, you can subscribe to it. One mechanism, five problems solved.

Address is identity, and address is hierarchical (your `rt/ms/sl/k` four-part is already the right shape). A cell is created by contract at an address pattern, and an unknown capability at forge time throws loudly. No silent half-bound cells.

```ts
const cursor = CELL("doc/42/cursor", {
  value: { line: 0, col: 0 },        // lww-register, authority: none (mergeable)
  merge: "lww",                       // a shard, so it's swappable per cell
  log:   { compact: 256 },            // keep tail, snapshot older
  sync:  "local-first",
  acl:   { read: "doc:42:readers", write: "doc:42:editors" },
});

const selection = DERIVE("doc/42/selection", [cursor, bounds], ([c, b]) => clamp(c, b));
```

`DERIVE` isn't sugar — it registers exact dependency edges `(address, version)` and produces a cell with the same rights as any other. Derived state is not a second-class citizen.

## Replication: causal by default, consensus only where truth requires it

Every cell carries a version vector plus an HLC stamp. Vectors decide *causally ready*; the clock only breaks ties for display order. Replication is delta-state: ship the ops the peer is missing, not the whole cell.

Then the important part: **merge policy is per-cell, and it's a shard.** Default is delta-CRDT (LWW register, OR-set, RGA, counters). But some state genuinely can't merge — uniqueness, invariants, "only one editor holds the lock." Those cells get an **authority lease**: a single writer elected through a small Raft/lease plane that lives entirely off the hot path. You write locally, immediately; the lease decides who wins on conflict. 99% of state never touches consensus, and the 1% that needs it says so in its contract.

And: **conflicts are values, not errors.** A multi-value register returns `[a, b]` and the UI shows both. Silent LWW loss is how you get ghost bugs nobody can reproduce. If a merge can't decide, the cell goes `diverged` and that's a visible state, subscribable like any other.

## Reactivity: push invalidation, pull computation, batched commit

Glitch-freedom comes from ordering, not from hoping. Derived cells recompute in topological order by version, once per commit. Writes land in a transaction: multiple cells, one commit id, subscribers see the entire group or none of it. No torn reads — that single property kills most of the "why did my UI flicker" class of bugs.

Dispatch uses the address trie with wildcard bitmasks, so a write on `doc/42/selection` doesn't walk a graph, it masks into the handler set that could possibly care. That's how you get god-cell capability without god-cell cost.

## Offline and partial: the log is local, the network is a shard

Every device keeps a durable local log (SQLite WAL or embedded KV). Cells load lazily on subscription; nothing else is resident. Reconnect is just: exchange version vectors, ship deltas, compact. Sync mode is declared per cell — `local-first`, `server-authoritative`, `local-only`, `ephemeral`. Presence and cursors are `ephemeral`: CRDT maps with heartbeat TTLs, never written to durable history.

## Two things most designs get wrong that I'd fix on day one

**Permission-aware projection.** A subscriber doesn't get the raw cell; it gets a projection filtered by its ACL. Reactive systems leak like sieves because "read" means "received." If the subscription can't see a field, the field never crosses the wire.

**Introspection as a first-class surface.** Every cell reports: version, last writer, current subscribers, divergence status, and the exact dependency edges that led to its value. "Why did this recompute" answers itself, because the edges are data.

## The refusals

- No global store. The store is always the bottleneck and the SPOF.
- No "everything is a graph you walk" — flat cells, indexed subscribers, no full traversal per update.
- No atoms/logic split. The log is a shard. The value is the fold. They travel together, always.
- No consensus on the write path for ordinary state.
- No silently discarded writes.

If I had no constraints, that's the shape: **one log-backed cell, per-cell merge policy, leases only where truth demands it, transactions for coherence, deltas everywhere, and the signal inseparable from the thing it animates.**

Want me to write this up as a proper spec — contracts, wire format for the vector/delta exchange, and the shard list mapped onto your existing 52?

<details><summary><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: monospace">[COPILOT]</span> </strong></summary>
Honestly? If I had zero constraints, I'd stop thinking about "state" entirely.

I'd build a distributed reactive reality graph.

Most state systems are fundamentally storage systems pretending to be reactive systems.

Redux, MobX, Zustand, Signals, Atoms, CRDTs, Yjs, event streams, buses, caches, databases... they're all slices of the same problem.

My dream system would unify all of it.

Core Idea

There is only:

Reality<T>


Everything else is a projection.

const user = Reality<User>()
const orders = Reality<Order[]>()
const inventory = Reality<Inventory>()


Not atoms.

Not collections.

Not stores.

Not documents.

Not caches.

Just realities.

Every reality exists simultaneously

Every reality can exist as:

hot
warm
cold
persistent
distributed
derived
remote
local


At the same time.

Example:

user.get()


could come from:

L1 local memory
L2 process cache
L3 machine cache
L4 cluster cache
L5 regional replica
L6 authoritative source


but the caller doesn't care.

State and events become the same thing

The biggest mistake in software:

State
Events


being different systems.

My dream system:

user.set(...)


creates:

event
version
history
stream notification
reactive update
replication packet


automatically.

Meaning:

user.subscribe()


and

bus.subscribe()


are literally the same implementation.

Every value is temporal

Nothing stores a value.

Everything stores:

Value +
Timestamp +
Version +
Origin +
Lifecycle


Meaning :

user.value


is actually:

{
    value,
    version,
    node,
    timestamp,
    causality
}


always.

Then time-travel becomes free.

Derived state becomes first-class

Today:

const fullName = computed(...)


Tomorrow:

const fullName =
    derive(user.first,user.last)


but:

fullName


is a real distributed object.

Not local.

Not recomputed everywhere.

The cluster understands it.

Queries become subscriptions

Today:

SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE active = true


returns rows.

Boring.

My dream system:

const activeUsers =
    query(users)
       .where(x => x.active)


returns:

Reality<User[]>


which updates forever.

The query itself becomes state.

Replication becomes reactive

Most systems:

storage
↓
replication
↓
cache
↓
ui


Layers.

I hate layers.

Instead:

mutation
↓
graph propagation


That's it.

A mutation enters the graph.

The graph decides:

who cares
where it lives
what replicas need it
who subscribed
which projections change

Every node can become authoritative

This is where I think things get wild.

Imagine:

Browser
Server
Worker
GPU
Phone
Edge
Cluster


All run identical realities.

Authority floats.

A node can temporarily own a piece of state.

Then ownership moves.

Almost like Raft and CRDTs had a baby.

The UI isn't reactive

The UI is just another node.

React shouldn't be special.

Vue shouldn't be special.

The browser shouldn't be special.

Database Node
Browser Node
Worker Node
GPU Node


All consume the exact same graph.

The UI becomes a rendering adapter.

Nothing more.

The graph understands causality

Instead of:

count++


The graph sees:

Mutation A
caused
Mutation B
which caused
Mutation C


Now debugging becomes:

trace(value)


and it shows the entire causal chain.

Every state change.

Forever.

What I'd actually optimize for

Not throughput.

Not latency.

Not memory.

I'd optimize for:

Cognitive Load


The real bottleneck in software is developers.

Not CPUs.

Not networks.

Developers.

The perfect reactive state system is one where a developer can reason about:

single process
multi process
multi machine
global cluster


using the exact same mental model.

The final form

The craziest version?

A system where:

const user = reality<User>()


is simultaneously:

atom
signal
observable
event stream
bus endpoint
cache entry
database row
replicated object
query source
distributed actor


and the developer never chooses which one.

The runtime chooses.

You don't build on top of storage.

You don't build on top of messaging.

You don't build on top of state.

You build on top of a living distributed graph that happens to expose state as one of its many views.

That's probably the direction I'd push if literally nothing held me back. And honestly, from a lot of what you've described over the months, your thinking is already drifting toward that same "collapse all the layers into one primitive" endgame. The bus, atoms, streams, subscriptions, caches, transports, queries, and storage all start looking like different projections of the same underlying graph.

</details>


<details><summary><strong><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: monospace">[DEEPAI]</span> </strong></summary>

I’d build it around one idea: **state should feel local to use, but be explicit about how it moves and changes.**

### The shape of it

- **A small reactive core:** immutable snapshots, fine-grained subscriptions, and computed values that update only when their actual dependencies change. No framework required.
- **A distributed state graph:** nodes can live on different devices or servers, but expose the same interface locally. Replication is an implementation detail until you need to reason about it.
- **Explicit consistency choices:** default to fast local writes with eventual convergence; let each state boundary opt into stronger guarantees—transactions, leader-ordered updates, or conflict-free merging—when the domain needs them.
- **Semantic conflicts, not magic merging:** counters, sets, text, and maps can use sensible merge strategies. For arbitrary objects, surface conflicts or require a resolver rather than silently picking a winner.
- **First-class effects:** network calls, persistence, timers, and subscriptions live in explicit effects with cancellation, retries, and clear ownership. Reading state stays pure.
- **Useful time travel:** every change has an origin, timestamp, and causal context. Make it easy to inspect history, replay a session, undo an action, or understand why a value changed.
- **Resilience by default:** offline operation, reconnect, duplicate delivery, reordered messages, schema migration, and partial failure are core cases—not plugin territory.
- **A simple programming model:** something like `state`, `derive`, `watch`, and `send`, with typed boundaries and generated schemas. Hide transport machinery until debugging or tuning requires it.

The API might look like:

```ts
const cart = state("cart", { items: [] }, {
  policy: "replicated",
  merge: cartMerge,
});

const total = derive(() =>
  cart.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0)
);

watch(total, value => renderTotal(value));

await cart.add(item); // optimistic locally; replicated automatically
```

The hard part wouldn’t be making updates reactive. It’d be making **causality, ownership, and conflict behavior legible** without making everyday code feel distributed. So I’d optimize for a lovely local experience, with escape hatches that make the distributed parts inspectable and explicit.

I’d build a **local-first, distributed reactive state graph**: every device owns a fast, durable local store; changes propagate as compact, causally ordered operations; and UI bindings update only the exact components that depend on changed data. The server would be a coordination/relay layer, not the source of truth. This combines the strengths of signals, CRDTs, and sync engines rather than bolting them together. [classic.yarnpkg](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@ankurah/react-hooks)

## Core model

The primitive would be a **distributed signal**: a small, typed, addressable unit of state with an identity, schema, ownership policy, and merge strategy.

```ts
const title = doc.field("title", {
  type: "LWWRegister<string>",
  policy: "author-wins",
});

const votes = doc.field("votes", {
  type: "PNCounter",
});

const visibleTasks = computed(() =>
  tasks.where(t => !t.done.value && t.owner.value === currentUser)
);
```

- **Signals** hold atomic values.
- **Computed values** derive from signals and track dependencies automatically.
- **Effects** write to the DOM, native UI, databases, notifications, or external APIs.
- **Documents/collections** group related signals and carry their replication rules.

This mirrors the standard fine-grained reactivity model—signals, computations, and effects—while making every signal capable of being replicated. [docs](https://docs.rs/leptos/0.8.15/aarch64-apple-darwin/leptos/reactive/index.html)

## Replication design

I would not make one global CRDT blob. Instead, I’d use **typed CRDTs per field or collection**, chosen by the semantics of the data:

| Data shape | Merge type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Single editable value | Last-writer-wins register | Task title |
| Add-only set | Grow-only set | Tags, reactions |
| Counter | PN-counter | Votes, view counts |
| Ordered list | Sequence CRDT | Comments, todo ordering |
| Rich text | Text CRDT | Document body |
| Structured record | Field-level map of CRDTs | User profile |
| Authoritative business value | Causal transaction + server adjudication | Billing, inventory |

CRDTs are useful because independently edited replicas can converge deterministically without a central arbiter; operation-based replication is especially attractive because it sends compact deltas rather than whole-state snapshots. [vocal](https://vocal.media/01/mastering-offline-first-data-sync-with-crd-ts-in-2026)

## The sync layer

The transport would be pluggable: WebSocket for live collaboration, WebRTC for peer-to-peer sessions, and background HTTP sync for reconnecting after long offline periods. The protocol would send **causally ordered operation batches**, compressed into deltas, with vector clocks or a compact causal-history structure to determine what a peer has already seen. [vocal](https://vocal.media/01/mastering-offline-first-data-sync-with-crd-ts-in-2026)

Key properties:

- **Optimistic local writes:** UI updates immediately from local state.
- **Durable local persistence:** SQLite on native/desktop, IndexedDB/OPFS on web.
- **Delta sync:** Never ship full documents when a field changed.
- **Idempotent application:** Replays and duplicates cannot corrupt state.
- **Backpressure and batching:** Coalesce bursts of edits into one frame or network batch.
- **Presence as ephemeral state:** Cursors, typing indicators, and selections never enter durable history.

## Permissions and trust

This is the hard part. I’d make authorization part of the data model, not an application afterthought.

Each document would have a **capability-based policy**:

```ts
doc.policy({
  read: ["team:engineering"],
  write: ["user:skyler", "role:owner"],
  fieldPolicy: {
    salary: ["role:hr"],
    status: ["role:manager"],
  },
});
```

Policies would be signed and attached to operations, so a peer can verify whether an incoming change was permitted even if the original server is unavailable. This follows the idea of coupling cryptographic identity with CRDT permissions so access rules can be enforced consistently across replicas. [fosdem.houseofmoran](https://fosdem.houseofmoran.io/2026/event/7445/)

For high-integrity domains—payments, inventory, compliance—I’d add **server-adjudicated transactions**: clients optimistically apply a proposed change, but the authoritative service validates it against invariants and issues a signed commit or rejection.

## Developer experience

The API should feel like ordinary reactive state, not distributed-systems plumbing.

```ts
const task = await store.get<Task>(taskId);

task.title.value = "Ship the sync engine";

effect(() => {
  label.textContent = task.title.value;
});
```

Under the hood, that assignment:

1. Writes locally.
2. Updates all dependent computeds and UI bindings.
3. Persists to the local store.
4. Emits a signed, typed operation.
5. Syncs it to peers when possible.
6. Merges deterministically if another device changed the same field.

No manual subscriptions, cache invalidation, refetching, or “is this stale?” checks. Fine-grained dependency tracking means a change to one signal re-runs only the computations and effects that actually read it. [classic.yarnpkg](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/package/@ankurah/react-hooks)

## Runtime architecture

```text
UI components
   │ reads/writes
   ▼
Reactive graph  ── effects ──▶ DOM / native / services
   │
   ▼
Typed document store
   │ local persistence
   ▼
Operation log + CRDT merge engine
   │
   ▼
Transport adapters: WebSocket / WebRTC / HTTP / background sync
   │
   ▼
Relay + policy service + optional authoritative transaction coordinator
```

The reactive graph would be **lazy and push-pull hybrid**: writes mark dirty nodes, while reads pull and recompute only what is needed. That avoids both global re-renders and unnecessary eager computation. [github](https://github.com/Roblox/signals)

## What I’d deliberately avoid

- **One giant JSON document per app.** It makes permissions, sync cost, and merge behavior painful.
- **CRDTs for everything.** Some values genuinely need a single authoritative decision.
- **Server as the only source of truth.** It destroys offline UX and makes every interaction latency-bound.
- **Client-only authorization.** It is convenient, but cannot safely enforce high-stakes invariants by itself.
- **Implicit global mutable state.** State should be addressable, typed, and scoped to a document or domain.

## The dream API

The end goal: a developer writes UI as if all state were local, while the runtime provides offline operation, multi-user collaboration, conflict resolution, encryption, permissions, observability, and time-travel debugging.

You would be able to ask questions like:

- “Which operation caused this UI value to change?”
- “Show me the merged state as of yesterday.”
- “Which devices are behind on this document?”
- “What would happen if this user’s writes were rejected?”
- “Replay this session without sending network operations.”

That is the version I’d build: **signals for UI ergonomics, CRDTs for convergence, capabilities for trust, SQLite/IndexedDB for durability, and a sync protocol designed around deltas and causal history.** The result would feel like React state, behave like a collaborative database, and remain usable on a plane with no internet.

# My dream: a local-first, log-based, incrementally-computed reactive store

If I had no constraints, I'd start from one belief: **the replica on the device is the source of truth, and the network is just a way for replicas to converge.** Everything else follows from that.

## 1. Storage: a signed, causal op log

- Every change is an immutable, signed operation with a hybrid logical clock and causal parents (a DAG, not a linear log).
- State is a materialized view of the log. Rich CRDT types (maps, sequences, counters, registers, sets) cover most data, and a Rust core compiled to WASM and native keeps it fast everywhere.
- You get time travel, forking, branching, and merging essentially for free. "Undo" and "what did this look like Tuesday" become queries, not features.

## 2. Reactivity: signals on the surface, differential dataflow underneath

- At the leaf level, fine-grained signals (push-pull, glitch-free) bind directly to the DOM or native views. No virtual DOM and no re-render model: a change to one field updates exactly the node that reads it.
- For anything derived (filters, joins, aggregates), I'd use **incremental view maintenance** (DBSP/differential-dataflow style). A query over 100k rows costs work proportional to the *change*, not the dataset.
- The same query definition runs on the client, the edge, and the server, so "derived state" is never duplicated logic.

## 3. Sync: topology-agnostic and partial

- A server is just a big, always-on peer. Peer-to-peer, relay, and edge all use the same protocol.
- Clients subscribe with *queries* (partial replication), so a phone doesn't need the whole world.
- Live updates use causal broadcast. Catch-up uses range-based set reconciliation, which is cheap when replicas are mostly in sync.

## 4. Consistency: pay only where invariants demand it

CRDTs can't enforce "usernames are unique" or "balance never goes negative." So I'd build in an invariant analyzer (based on I-confluence and the CALM theorem):

- You declare invariants in the schema.
- The compiler tells you which operations are coordination-free and which aren't.
- Coordinated operations use escrow/reservations or scoped consensus, and the API returns a *confirmation promise*, so the UI is honestly optimistic.
- Optimistic local ops live in a rebasable layer that is reapplied cleanly as remote ops arrive.

## 5. Security belongs in the log

- Authorization is capability-based (UCAN/Biscuit-like) and enforced on ops, since there's no trusted server to lean on.
- End-to-end encryption with group key management that handles rotation and revocation (Keyhive-style).
- Metadata leakage is treated as a first-class design concern.

## 6. The unglamorous parts that make it real

- **Schema evolution:** bidirectional lenses, so old and new clients keep collaborating.
- **GC and compaction:** causal-stability snapshots and tombstone pruning in epochs, because unbounded history kills most CRDT systems in production.
- **Side effects:** effects like "send email" are written to the log as intents, and a deterministic lease picks one executor. Exactly-once-ish without a central coordinator.
- **Resource budgets:** per-subscription limits on memory, bandwidth, and history depth.

## 7. Developer experience

You'd write a declarative schema plus derived queries and get typed APIs, sync, persistence (OPFS/SQLite), and devtools for free. The devtools would show the causal graph, pending ops, and why a given value won a conflict, since "why is my data like this?" is the question that haunts these systems.

## Honest tradeoffs

- Per-op metadata overhead is real, and so is the cost of keeping history.
- Text and list CRDTs still have interleaving and intent-preservation edge cases.
- Truly global invariants will always cost you a round trip.
- Debuggability suffers unless you invest heavily in tooling, which is why I'd build it early.

## Build order

1. Op log + one CRDT map + signals + DOM binding
2. Persistence and the sync protocol
3. Incremental queries
4. Capabilities and encryption
5. The invariant analyzer (the most novel and risky piece)

If you tell me your platform and constraints, I can narrow this down to something buildable. What are you running on?

If budget, legacy baggage, and framework dogma didn't matter, building the ultimate distributed reactive state engine means stripping away virtual DOM diffing, dynamic proxies, garbage collection pressure, and event-loop blocking overhead. It requires treating state as a continuous, deterministic stream of raw binary deltas flowing directly through lock-free memory rings and multi-threaded actor boundaries.

Here is the blueprint for a zero-compromise, ultra-high-performance distributed reactive state architecture.

---

### 1. The Reactive Core: Zero-Proxy Signals & Topological Scheduling

Conventional reactivity relies on Proxy objects or heavy dependency graphs that chew up CPU cycles and memory. The dream engine uses **flat integer-indexed bitmask graphs** and stack-allocated evaluation frames.

* **Integer-ID PIDs:** Every signal, computed value, and effect is represented not as an object reference, but as a numeric ID (`PID`) pointing to fixed-size memory slots.
* **Static Topological Sorting:** Instead of dynamic runtime dependency tracking on every read, dependencies are resolved during compile-time or initial binding phases into strict execution vectors. When a source signal mutates, it walks a flat array of subscriber PIDs—avoiding tree traversal overhead entirely.
* **Glitch-Free Propagation:** Using level-triggered topological sorting guarantees that diamond dependencies (where $A \rightarrow B$, $A \rightarrow C$, $B,C \rightarrow D$) evaluate downstream nodes exactly once per tick, eliminating intermediate invalid states.

---

### 2. Memory Architecture: Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) & Slab Allocation

Garbage collection is the mortal enemy of high-frequency reactivity. The engine abandons object-oriented heap allocation in favor of contiguous memory blocks.

* **Binary Slab Pools (`STORAGE_RING`):** State values live in pre-allocated `SharedArrayBuffer` blocks partitioned into typed byte arrays (`Float64Array`, `Int32Array`, `BigInt64Array`).
* **Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) Layout:** Rather than storing state as an array of structs (e.g., `{ id, value, timestamp }`), properties are stored in parallel contiguous arrays. This maximizes CPU cache line utilization (`L1/L2/L3`), allowing vector instructions (SIMD) to process batch state transformations in single CPU cycles.
* **Zero-Allocation Mutators:** State updates write directly to raw memory offsets via typed views. No wrapper objects are created, meaning zero GC pauses even under tens of millions of state transitions per second.

---

### 3. Concurrency & Inter-Thread Transport: Lock-Free Ring Buffers

State management shouldn't starve the main UI thread. Computation, network serialization, and UI rendering must run in parallel across isolated worker threads or web workers.

* **Atomic CAS Ring Buffers:** Threads communicate via single-producer, multi-consumer (SPMC) lock-free ring buffers backed by atomic operations (`Atomics.load`, `Atomics.store`, `Atomics.compareExchange`).
* **Shared Memory Actor Model:** Workers don't pass serialized JSON messages over message ports; they pass 32-bit pointers pointing to shared memory slab segments. The receiving thread gains instant read access without deserialization overhead.
* **Microtask Batching & AIMD Throttling:** Rapid bursts of state updates are collected into microtask windows and adaptively throttled using closed-loop congestion control (AIMD), ensuring the render thread never receives more frames than it can physically paint (locked to 120Hz/240Hz refresh rates).

---

### 4. Distributed State Synchronization (DRS)

Scaling reactivity across network boundaries (client-to-client or client-to-edge nodes) requires deterministic state replication without heavy consensus algorithms like Raft for local UI state.

* **Append-Only Binary Logs:** Every state mutation generates a compact 16-to-32-byte binary packet (Header: `SourcePID`, `Timestamp`, `OperationType`, `PayloadLength` + Raw Bytes).
* **Deterministic Delta Propagation:** Instead of syncing whole state trees, nodes stream binary delta logs over low-latency binary protocols (QUIC/WebSockets using binary ArrayBuffers).
* **Conflict-Free Replicated State Routing:** For concurrent writes, state slots use conflict-free resolution strategies baked into the slab layout (e.g., Last-Write-Wins with hybrid logical clocks, or state-based CRDT registers) resolved deterministically at the byte level without locks.

---

### The Result

The ultimate reactive engine looks less like a traditional frontend framework runtime and more like a high-frequency trading execution engine: **flat arrays, atomic integers, shared memory, and direct CPU cache utilization**. It executes state changes in nanoseconds, scales horizontally across threads and network nodes, and maintains absolute determinism with zero garbage collection overhead.
